Team Members: Nikhil,Kevyn,Jodi

Description: This project aims to analyze crime data of Toronto city using Toronto police datasets and CMHC Rental Market Survey.The project will be required to answer the following questions:

Main Hypothesis:As a family of 3, what is the safest neighbourhood to live in based on this Toronto neighbourhood crime rate data?
The perfect neighborhood is one with very few physical attacks, but the frequency of bike thefts is not a concern.
The perfect neighborhood may not necessarily have the lowest crime rate, but it should have rental prices that are reasonable.
Areas with high crime rates generally have a higher number of car accidents as well.
Neighborhoods with lower crime rates tend to have higher rental prices, making them more desirable. Conversely, neighborhoods with higher crime rates tend to havelower rental prices, making them less desirable.
The overall crime rate in Toronto has been decreasing over time due to advancements in technology, changes in policing methods, and increased funding.
